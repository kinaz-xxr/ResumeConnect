Our inspiration for Resume Exchange stemmed from a desire to create a collaborative platform where individuals can share their resumes and receive constructive feedback. We noticed that many of our peers often struggle with perfecting their resumes and wanted to provide an engaging and efficient way to facilitate peer-to-peer resume reviews.

When we saw the Neurelo sponsor prize, we realized our idea perfectly aligned with their mission to foster innovative learning tools. We decided to create a platform that not only simplifies the process of getting feedback on resumes but also leverages AI to enhance the quality of feedback and suggestions for improvements.

üîé What it Does"Resume Exchange" is an interactive platform designed to help people improve their resumes through community feedback. Users can upload their resumes and receive comments from others. The project offers three main features:

Resume Upload and Sharing: Users can upload their resumes to the platform and share them with the community.
Feedback and Comments: Other users can provide feedback and comments on the resumes, offering constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.
AI-Generated Alternative Resumes: Leveraging AI, the platform analyzes the feedback and generates alternative versions of the resume, incorporating the suggested improvements.
This approach not only provides users with diverse perspectives on their resumes but also uses AI to ensure that feedback is implemented effectively, enhancing the overall quality of the resumes.
üî® How We Built ItTo build our project, we used React for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. For the backend, we utilized Flask and MongoDB to handle the data storage and management. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability, making it well-suited for our project's needs.

We also integrated Neurelo to validate and generate datasets for our schemas, as well as to generate full APIs based on the schema. Neurelo's capabilities were integral to our project, streamlining the development process and ensuring the integrity of our data.

Additionally, we used AI to analyze the feedback provided by users and to generate alternative resumes. This AI component was crucial in automating the process of improving resumes based on the feedback received.

üöß Challenges We Ran IntoDuring our project, one of the major challenges we faced was the initial learning curve associated with using MongoDB and Neurelo. As it was our first time working with these technologies, we had to invest time in understanding their functionalities and how to integrate them effectively into our project.

We also encountered issues with the Neurelo SDK, which posed challenges in terms of configuration and implementation. To overcome this, we decided to bypass the SDK and use Neurelo‚Äôs API routes directly. This adjustment required careful review of our approach but ultimately allowed us to achieve the desired functionality.

Another significant challenge was ensuring that the AI-generated feedback and alternative resumes were accurate and meaningful. This required fine-tuning our AI algorithms to interpret feedback correctly and apply it in a way that genuinely enhanced the resumes.

üéñÔ∏è Accomplishments That We're Proud OfDespite the challenges, we are particularly proud of the platform's ability to generate AI-powered alternative resumes. This feature showcases our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to provide valuable tools for users. Additionally, the professional and user-friendly UI we developed enhances the overall user experience and reflects our dedication to quality.

üìï What We LearnedThrough this project, we gained valuable insights into the integration of AI in web applications and the practical uses of MongoDB and Neurelo. Working with these technologies expanded our technical skills and deepened our understanding of database management and AI implementation.

We also learned the importance of flexibility and adaptability when encountering obstacles, such as the issues with the Neurelo SDK. This experience taught us how to pivot and find alternative solutions to keep our project on track.

By continually improving our platform and expanding its features, we aim to make Resume Exchange an invaluable tool for anyone looking to perfect their resume and advance their career.
